      <h2>Cars — Deep Dives</h2>

      <article id="a1">
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1150x600/?tesla,model-s,car" alt="Tesla Model S Plaid">
        <h3>Tesla Model S Plaid — Performance, Software, & Real-World Tradeoffs</h3>
        <p>The Model S Plaid is the visceral expression of EV capability: three electric motors, sub-2 second 0–60 acceleration in ideal conditions, and an integrated software-first ownership model that evolves over time. But raw speed hides complexities: thermal management under repeated high-power launches, battery chemistry tradeoffs for peak power, and the real-world gap between manufacturer range and highway use at high speeds.</p>
        <p>Where Tesla wins: instant torque, Supercharger network, and a living platform that adds features via OTA updates. Where it lags: fit-and-finish variability and occasional software regressions that affect user trust. For buyers wanting straight-line dominance and constant updates — Plaid is unmatched. For those who want consistent mechanical polish and predictable track feel — take note of alternatives like the Taycan.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> ~1,020 hp | ~396 mi WLTP estimate (real-world varies) | 0–60 mph &lt;2s | Supercharging network advantage.</div>
      </article>

      <article id="a2">
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1150x600/?porsche,taycan,car" alt="Porsche Taycan">
        <h3>Porsche Taycan Turbo S — Engineering That Respects the Driver</h3>
        <p>Porsche’s Taycan is less about headline numbers and more about human-scale control. The Taycan Turbo S balances electrical packaging with Porsche’s signature chassis calibration — result: aggressive lap times with reassuring thresholds. The two-speed setup on the rear axle and aggressive regenerative braking mapping provide unique track-friendly behavior.</p>
        <p>Compared to Tesla, Porsche’s approach is conservative: shorter peak range but a much more communicative steering feel and stronger braking fade resistance at track use. If you drive for engagement and feel, the Taycan delivers a repeatable, confidence-inspiring experience. If you drive long-distance regularly and want charging ubiquity, Tesla still leads.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> up to ~750 hp (depending on spec) | 0–60 mph ~3.0s | Range varies by config (approx 220–300 mi).</div>

      <article id="a3">
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1150x600/?ford,mustang,mach-e" alt="Ford Mustang Mach-E">
        <h3>Ford Mustang Mach-E GT — Bringing Muscle to EVs without the Drama</h3>
        <p>Ford’s Mach-E blends a familiar brand personality with modern EV packaging. The GT trims deliver near-sports-car acceleration, while lower trims focus on daily refinement and range efficiency. Ford balances consumer-friendly software with third-party charging compatibility, which is crucial in regions where manufacturer networks are patchy.</p>
        <p>As a family-friendly EV with a sporty badge, Mach-E hits a sweet spot. Owners praise ergonomics and software stability more than pure performance benchmarks — making it a pragmatic alternative to high-hype performance EVs.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> ~0–60 mph from ~3.5s (GT) | range 270–314 mi depending on battery/trim.</div>
      </article>

        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1150x600/?bmw,i4,car" alt="BMW i4">
        <h3>BMW i4 — Driving Dynamics Reimagined Electrically</h3>
        <p>BMW’s i4 focuses on keeping the soul of the brand: steering feedback, chassis balance, and driver engagement. The electric platform allows weight distribution advantages, and BMW tunes suspension and damping to deliver responsive cornering without a severe ride penalty.</p>
        <p>The i4 competes with premium EV sedans by offering a driver-first cockpit and solid materials. If your priority is an interactive drive rather than straight-line supremacy, the i4 is built with you in mind.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> ~300–536 hp depending on variant | 0–60 mph ~3.8s (M Performance) | practical range ~250–300 mi.</div>
