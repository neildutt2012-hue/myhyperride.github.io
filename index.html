    <h2>Topic of the Day — AI-Powered Vehicles: The Practical & Dangerous Truth</h2>
    <p>From adaptive vision stacks to predictive maintenance, AI is reprogramming cars from the ground up. Today we unpack what’s real, what’s marketing, and who wins — drivers, fleets, or regulators. Deep dives follow below.</p>

      <h2>Cars — Deep Dives</h2>

      <article id="a1">
        <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1150x600/?tesla,model-s&sig=201" alt="Tesla Model S Plaid">
        <h3>Tesla Model S Plaid — Performance, Software, & Real-World Tradeoffs</h3>
        <p>The Model S Plaid is a showcase of modern electric performance: overwhelming straight-line speed, a software platform that improves over time, and a charging network built for long-distance driving. Under intense acceleration, thermal management becomes critical — repeat track runs can show higher battery temperatures and reduced peak output until cooled.</p>
        <p>Tesla’s edge is the living product experience: features arrive by OTA updates, navigation integrates Superchargers, and the ecosystem is tightly coupled. Downsides include variable build finish and an ownership experience that sometimes feels like early-adopter software beta testing.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> ~1,020 hp | ~396 mi range (real-world varies) | 0–60 mph &lt;2s | Supercharger network.</div>

        <h3>Porsche Taycan Turbo S — Precision that Rewards Drivers</h3>
        <p>Porsche built the Taycan for drivers who want feedback and control. It’s not only about peak numbers; engineering choices (two-speed rear axle, robust brakes, finely tuned chassis) make the Taycan a repeatable performer on track and a composed tourer on the road.</p>
        <p>If you prize communication and driving craft, Taycan will consistently feel more purposeful. If you prize charging coverage and occasional blistering acceleration, Tesla remains more convenient in many regions.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> Up to ~750 hp (varies by trim) | 0–60 mph ~3.0s | Range ~220–300 mi depending on spec.</div>

        <h3>Ford Mustang Mach-E GT — Muscle-Car Heritage, Electric Future</h3>
        <p>The Mach-E brings a storied badge into the EV age with trims that range from efficient commuters to the GT performance variant. Ford focused on delivering a clear product for families and performance-minded buyers alike: the GT offers near-sportscar acceleration while standard trims emphasize range and cabin ergonomics.</p>
        <p>Pragmatic features like robust infotainment, familiar ergonomics, and third-party charger compatibility make Mach-E one of the best all-round EVs for everyday use.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> GT ~0–60 mph 3.5s | Range 270–314 mi (trim-dependent).</div>

        <h3>BMW i4 — The Electric Car That Still Talks to the Driver</h3>
        <p>BMW’s philosophy with the i4 is simple: retain the interactive driving dynamics the brand is known for while transferring the benefits of electrification to handling and balance. The i4's chassis tuning and steering precision provide responsive behavior without being punishing on daily drives.</p>
        <p>It’s a solid pick for owners who want electric efficiency while preserving driver engagement and brand DNA.</p>
        <div class="specs"><strong>Key specs:</strong> 300–536 hp (varies) | 0–60 mph ~3.8s (M Performance) | range ~250–300 mi.</div>
